Diseases like Malaria, Pneumonia, Breast cancer and Skin cancer are very common and suffering patients are increasing every day. So our team has created a Helath Discernment System which will detect if a patient is suffering from Malaria, Pneumonia, Breast cancer or Skin cancer by taking an essential input image. The frontend of this product is created using CSS,HTML and JS Tkinter module and for backend, four different custom CNN models are developed for detecting the diseases.
